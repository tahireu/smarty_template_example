# Template example
This is a Smarty PHP theme example created in representational/portfolio purposes.

Maybe you will notice that _.scss files are not imported into one single .scss file, as it is specified in the SCSS/Sass documentation. Each of them is compiled individually. This is because of specificity of the environment in which these templates were created.
